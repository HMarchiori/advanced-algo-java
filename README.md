# Advanced Algorithm Design and Optimization â€” PUCRS

This repository contains the theoretical and practical materials developed throughout the course **Advanced Algorithm Design and Optimization** (`Projeto e OtimizaÃ§Ã£o de Algoritmos`), part of the undergraduate Computer Science curriculum at **Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS)**.

The course emphasizes the design, formal analysis, and optimization of algorithmic solutions for complex computational problems, with a focus on both classical paradigms and heuristic approaches.

By the end of this course, students are expected to:

- Understand and analyze major algorithm design techniques;
- Accurately formalize computational problems using mathematical notation;
- Select the most suitable algorithmic paradigm for a given problem;
